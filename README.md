# Audio Visualiser for Wallpaper Engine

A wallpaper engine script which makes an audio visualiser based on the asset you bind it to. 

Unlike normal visualiser scripts which scale a model/asset vertically while duplicating horizontally, this duplicates on both axes(local).

The model used must be named "Bar" prior to importing into the scene. 

Rotation, spacing and scaling are all configurable on top of changing coloumn and row sizes.



## Deployment

To attach this script to a model, navigate to the cogwheel shown after selecting your "bar" asset:

Upon opening the dropdown, select the "Edit Script" option:

A script editor window will pop up:

Now, simply paste in the code in the Code.txt file:

Change the constants how you want them and play with them. Run the preview and play any audio to see the visualiser running:

On default configuration:
